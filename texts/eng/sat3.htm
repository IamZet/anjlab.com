<p>This is result of our joint research together with professor Romanov (VlGU, Vladimir).The project  is reference implementation of algorithm introduced in  Romanovï¿½s article <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3944" target="_new">Non-orthodox combinatorial models based on discordant structures</a>  published on arXiv.org.</p>
<p>This paper introduces a novel method for compact representation of sets of n-dimensional binary sequences in a form of compact triplets structures (CTS), supposing both logic and arithmetic interpretations of data. Suitable illustration of CTS application is the unique graph-combinatorial model for the classic intractable 3-Satisfiability problem and a polynomial algorithm for the model synthesis. The method used for Boolean formulas analysis and classification by means of the model is defined as a bijective mapping principle for sets of components of discordant structures to a basic set. The statistic computer-aided experiment showed efficiency of the algorithm in a large scale of problem dimension parameters, including those that make enumeration procedures of no use. The formulated principle expands resources of constructive approach to investigation of intractable problems. </p>
<p>Our implementation is published it as open source (LGPLv3)  <a href="https://github.com/anjlab/sat3" target="_new">on github</a>. Currently this implementation is in public beta and may have bugs. Go <a href="https://github.com/anjlab/sat3/downloads" target="_new">grab it</a>, <a href="https://github.com/anjlab/sat3/blob/master/README.md" target="_new">test it</a> and <a href="https://github.com/anjlab/sat3/issues" target="_new">submit issues</a> if you find them.</p> 
<p>Any feedback is appreciated.</p>
